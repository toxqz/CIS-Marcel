# 🛡️ Cognitive Immunity System (CIS) – v1.0

## 📌 Concept
This project documents a philosophical–cognitive system developed by a human intelligence known as **Marcel**,
designed to function as a **Cognitive Immunity System** – a defense architecture against mental and informational pollution.

The system mimics biological immunity structures to identify, isolate, and neutralize cognitive intrusions such as:
- Propaganda
- Emotional manipulation
- Unfiltered content overflow
- Existential destabilization

## 🧠 Core Structure
Inspired by human biology:

- **Skin** → Cognitive Boundaries
- **Blood** → Flow of Meaning
- **Clotting** → Response to Trauma
- **Bandage** → Temporary Conscious Retreat

Each layer serves to preserve inner clarity and rebuild disrupted meaning after "mental infections".

## 🔒 Ownership & Authorship

This architecture is the intellectual and symbolic property of **Marcel**.
It was developed through lived epistemic practice, not as a technical suggestion or abstract theory.

This repository exists to document the existence of the system and the awareness behind it — **not to open-source the original code**.

## 📬 Contact

No response is guaranteed. Recognition, not validation, is the purpose of this construct.

## 🧿 Final Note

This system is not an invention.  
It is a *wound that turned into armor*.
